NAME
    amssrv -- Authority Management Server

SYNOPSIS
    amssrv

DESCRIPTION
    amssrv is the server program which acts as the local mediator of MINTIA
    authority management. It uses IPC to talk to other processes on the same
    machine, in order to do actions such as logon, user querying, password
    changes, etc. It should not be invoked directly.

    User information is stored in two files:

  * /mintia/groups.cfg    Stores group name information.
  * /mintia/users.cfg     Stores user name, preferences, and quota information.
