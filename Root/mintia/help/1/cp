NAME
    cp -- copy file

SYNOPSIS
    cp [-ru] source target

DESCRIPTION
    cp copies the source file to the target. If the target is a directory, the
    source file will be copied to the directory and retain its old name. If the
    target directory exists, but the target name does not, the file will be
    copied with the new target name.

    The switches are as follows:

    -r      Recursively copy directories.
    -u      Open the files noncached.
