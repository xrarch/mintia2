NAME
    mount -- mount a filesystem volume

SYNOPSIS
    mount [[-ru] device [fstype]]

DESCRIPTION
    mount mounts a filesystem volume on the given device. The caller must have
    the appropriate permissions to the volume, i.e. if mounting normally then
    the caller must have ACCESS_WRITE and ACCESS_READ, but if mounting readonly
    then the caller need only have ACCESS_READ. If no arguments are provided,
    mount prints a list of the system's mounted volumes. A filesystem type may
    be explicitly specified.

    The switches are as follows:

    -i      Ignore UIDs on the mount; all files on the volume appear as being
            owned by whoever happens to be looking.
    -r      Mount read-only.
    -u      Update the flags of an existing mount.
    -o      All files on the volume appear to have a matching UID and GID with
            the owner of the device.
