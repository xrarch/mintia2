NAME
    mkfs_aisixfs -- create a new AisixFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
    mkfs_aisixfs [disk name]

DESCRIPTION
    mkfs_aisixfs creates an AisixFS volume on the specified disk device. This is
    a destructive process that will overwrite anything else on the disk. It will
    display parameters for the filesystem it will create and prompt the user for
    confirmation, and then the disk will be formatted. The disk is accessed non-
    cached.

    The switches are as follows:

    -s      Don't print information about the filesystem.
    -v      Print extra information about the creation process.
    -y      Don't prompt for confirmation.

HISTORY
    Ported from AISIX.
