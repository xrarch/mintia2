NAME
    passwd -- change password

SYNOPSIS
    passwd [username]

DESCRIPTION
    This utility is used to change a user's password. A user can change their
    own password without administrator assistance by specifying no username on
    the command line.

    You may change the password of an arbitrary user by specifying a username,
    but it must either match that of the current user, or the current user must
    be an administrator, otherwise a permission-denied diagnostic will be
    displayed. You must supply the old password, unless you are an administrator
    changing the password of another user.
