NAME
    swapon -- list or set pagefiles

SYNOPSIS
    swapon [path minsize maxsize priority]

DESCRIPTION
    swapon creates a new pagefile. The pagefile will begin at minsize and may
    grow up to maxsize over time as the system consumes more virtual memory
    commitment. Pagefiles are filled from the lowest-numbered priority upwards.

    If no arguments are specified, a list of the currently set pagefiles will be
    printed.
