NAME
    aptdisk -- manage an APT (a3x partition table) volume.

SYNOPSIS
    aptdisk [disk name]

DESCRIPTION
    aptdisk displays menus that allow the user to manage an APT volume. Disks
    can be queried, partitioned (which is a destructive process), labeled, etc.
    The actual disk device should be specified, as opposed to one of the
    partition devices, i.e. :dks1 and not :dks1s0. The disk is accessed non-
    cached.

HISTORY
    Ported from "limnvol" from the aisix standalone tools (which ran in the a3x
    firmware environment). This tool is in a sorry state due to its age and
    should be rewritten some day.
